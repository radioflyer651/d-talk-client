# DChat2

This is the front-end for DTalk2, a multi-agent chat application.  it's written in Angular 19, though not all of the newest Angular features are used.

See the server repo for more information about this application. (https://github.com/radioflyer651/d-talk-server)

## Getting Started

For the most part, the front end works like any Angular application.  Note that, instead of running on port 4200, it's setup to run on port 54647 by default (see the angular.json file).

When running locally, be sure your servers CORS settings reflect this, by allowing `http://localhost:54647`.
