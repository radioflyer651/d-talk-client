# Chat Room Detail Component

This component will be composed of 4 columns:
Project Chat Agents: All chat agent configurations defined in the project.
Project Chat Jobs: All chat job configurations defined in the project.

Room Chat Agents: Chat agent instances, created from the chat agent configurations in the project.
Room Chat Jobs: Chat job instances, created from the chat job configurations in the project.

Users will be able to drag chat agents onto the chat room agents area, thus creating new agents for the room.
Users will be able to drag chat jobs onto the chat room jobs area, thus creating new jobs for the room.
Finally, users will be able to drag chat room agents onto the chat room jobs, thus assigning agents to the chat jobs.

The ultimate goal of this detail is to allow the user to create new chat agents and chat jobs from project templates, and then assign their new agents to the new chat jobs.
